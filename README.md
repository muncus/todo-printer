## Print my Todo List (from Todoist).

I like paper, but updating (and keeping track of) a paper todo list isn't easy.

So ive hooked up a thermal printer to a raspberry pi, and now i can print a new
list whenever i want!



## Future work
* html templates for todolist output
* config file parsing, to hold token
